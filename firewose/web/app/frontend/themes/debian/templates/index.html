<h2>{{ self.title() }}</h2>

<p>
  Welcome to this draft of <em>Firewose</em>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: the look and feel is currently
  Debianic, but easily themable. Currently, the only debian-specific
  feature is the display of source code, because I don't know if there
  is such an equivalent service (sources.debian.net) for the sources
  of Fedora. If so, I'd be happy to add it!
</p>
<p>
  Currently you can find in the database:
  <ul>
    <li>results from python-ethtool and policycoreutils
    from <a href="https://github.com/fedora-static-analysis/firehose-saved-data">firehose-saved-data</a>;</li>
    <li>results from Coccinelle, with 3 semantic patches on Debian
    packages beginning with 'f' and 'r'.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Have fun and report feedback/bugs/wishes!
</p>
