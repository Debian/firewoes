* TODO unicity for Issue, Failure, Info
  when they are checked by get_fh_unique, the attribute analysis_id is
  not set yet, so the session.add() fails.
  This is due to the difference between XML and DB:
  XML: <analysis><results>...</results>
  DB: {result analysis_id=42 ...}

* TODO CustomFields mapping
* TODO Filter: better performances
  Filter queries all the corresponding results to extract the relevant
  information, this is expensive.
  Try: do this db-side, with multiple queries?
