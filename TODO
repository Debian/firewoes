* TODO unicity for Issue, Failure, Info
  when they are checked by get_fh_unique, the attribute analysis_id is
  not set yet, so the session.add() fails.
  This is due to the difference between XML and DB:
  XML: <analysis><results>...</results>
  DB: {result analysis_id=42 ...}

* TODO CustomFields mapping
* TODO Filter: better performances

  information, this is expensive.
  Try: do this db-side, with multiple queries?
* TODO Theme option could be a path too
* TODO Set correctly the height of source-code in details.html
  Iceweasel doesn't like the 100% (parent <td> height is not set)
  However it works fine with Chromium
* TODO social
