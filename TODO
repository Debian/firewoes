* TODO CustomFields mapping
* TODO Filter: better performances
  Filter queries all the corresponding results to extract the relevant
  information, this is expensive.
  Try: do this db-side, with multiple queries?
* TODO Set correctly the height of source-code in details.html
  Iceweasel doesn't like the 100% (parent <td> height is not set)
  However it works fine with Chromium
* TODO social
  thumbs up/down
  comments on results
  authentication: http://wiki.debian.org/DebianSingleSignOn
* TODO search by people
  ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/indices/Uploaders
* TODO bug: uniquify
  when trying to uniquify a list of results:
  <failure>
  <issue1>
  <issue2>
  with issue1 == issue2,
  SQLAlchemy tries to compare an issue with a failure (??), which fails
  
* TODO performances: replace UNION by something else
  requests with both failures and issues are incredibly slow
  idea: all 3 types (issue, failure, info) in the same table
* TODO views on home (shortcuts for generator, etc)
* TODO  previews on home (last results, widgets, ...)
* TODO infra: debuild.me -> sync with Paul & LÃ©o
* TODO failureid & info id mapping to testid
  Y THIS NO WORK??
